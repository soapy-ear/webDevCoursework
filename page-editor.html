        A clean and organized theme page with a user-friendly navigation bar can significantly improve the online shopping experience.

        CSS coding played a crucial role in achieving a cleaner and more professional design for the website.
        It allowed for the creation of consistent padding and spacing throughout the pages, resulting in a more polished and visually appealing layout.
        However, some parts of the coding process may have been time-consuming due to the attention to detail required for a high-quality design.
